<div>
<h2 id="macros">Macros</h2>
<p>
I'm a big VIM user and enjoy working in it, both professionally and
recreationally. One of vim's nice features is the ability to record macros into
a register and then replay it. As the macros can include motion, you can set
them up so that they can be easily repeated and use a count modifier, like
<tt>22@w</tt> to apply them multiple times. Do <tt>:h complex-repeat</tt> to
learn more.
</p>
<p>
However, there are some drawbacks to VIM macros. If you have a long or
complicated sequence of actions, it can be error prone to record the exact
macro needed to do what you want. They are stored in normal registers, so you
can paste them into a buffer, edit them and then yank them back into a
register, but that is pretty annoying and they quickly get unreadable.
</p>
<p>
Another common pitfall is you realize after executing the macro that you need
some small thing changed or some additional transform. You then have to either
edit the macro or record a new one from scratch. Do this a few times and you'll
find you spent more time trying to record the perfect macro than just doing the
text operation. And good luck debugging it if your macro isn't quite right.
</p>
<p>
If only we could write the text transforms as code. Wait a minute...
</p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>
<p>
Vim also has the feature that you can shell out to arbitrary programs,
writing to their stdin and reading from their stdout. You can feed them an
entire buffer or a selection of a buffer. The input lines are then replaced
with whatever the program wrote to stdout. Vim refers to these as "filters"
and invoke them with filter commands. Do <tt>:h filter</tt> to learn more.
</p>
<p>
In my experience, a better alternative to recording a complicated macro is to
just write a simple python script as the filter program.
As we are just writing normal code, this means it can be
arbitrarily complicated and you could even do syntactic/semantic analysis for
your custom text transforms. Additionally, it's just normal code instead of
weird editor commands so you can easily test and debug the transform if it's
getting hairy, write functions, break it up into multiple statements, etc.
</p>

<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>
<p>
Recently I was working with some C code where I needed to generate an X-macro
from a list of names. Example input would look like:
</p>
<div>
<pre>
Potion of Healing
Wand of Fireball
Magic Sword
...  etc ...

</pre>
</div>
<p>
I would like this to be converted to an X-macro, defining various forms of the names:
</p>
<div>
<pre>
// #define X(UPPER, Title, snake, string)
#define XNames(X) \
  X(POTION_OF_HEALING, Potion_of_Healing, potion_of_healing, "Potion of Healing") \
  X(WAND_OF_FIREBALL, Wand_of_Fireball, wand_of_fireball, "Wand of Fireball") \
  X(MAGIC_SWORD, Magic_Sword, magic_sword, "Magic Sword") \
  ... etc ...

</pre>
</div>
<p>
You can do this with vim commands and macros, but it is not easy. But behold, the simple
python script that does this conversion:
</p>
<pre class="python">
<span class="import">import</span> sys
<span class="control">for</span> line <span class="keyword">in</span> sys.stdin:
    l = line.strip()
    s = l.replace(<span class="string">' '</span>, <span class="string">'_'</span>)
    print(f<span class="string">'    X({s.upper()}, {s}, {s.lower()}, "{l}") \\'</span>)

</pre>
<p>
Simple, easy to understand code. You can debug it, you can throw examples at
it, whatever. I usually name these little scripts f.py in my working directly
and invoke them with <tt>:'&lt;,'&gt;!python3 f.py</tt>.
</p>
<p>
That's it! When you find yourself trying to setup a complicated macro, stop
and think if it would be easier to express it as a little script that
processes stdin instead. Most of the time, the answer is yes.
